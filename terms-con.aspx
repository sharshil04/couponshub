            <p>In the event that the Retailers do no track a transaction using their affiliate tracking system, then such sales might not be paid to Coupons Hub, and hence any due or expected donation amount from these sales will also not be credited to the charity selected by the Member.</p>

            <p>We are not directly involved to any transactions with Retailers, and are not the seller or supplier of any of the goods or services that they make available. Thus we do not have any of the legal obligations that apply to the sellers of those goods or services.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we have no control over or responsibility for:</p>
            <p>the quality, safety, or legality of those goods or services available from Retailers; or whether the Retailer can or will supply and pass good title to any goods or services.</p>
            <p>Members should exercise no lesser degree of caution in entering into transactions with Retailers than they would when entering into a similar transaction offline. To the extent that the Applicable Law permits, you release us, our agents and employees from all liability arising out of or in connection with any transactions with Retailers, including (without limitation) all claims and demands relating to uncompleted or completed transactions with Retailers, or goods or services offered for sale or supply, or actually sold or supplied, through or in connection with any transactions with Retailers.</p>

Any Member, who in the sole discretion of the Retailer or us, has committed fraud in use of the Site or our Donation Service or misused the Site or the Donation Service, their Account will be closed, email and IP address will be blacklisted so they cannot use it again, and cannot register from the same PC.</p>
